# Lethal Company Wristwatch - 11/20/23

shows the time at all times in lethal company, whether you are hosting or not. it has a faster refresh-rate, too! 

join a game, and run the code. it works as of BUILD 12681469. there is no anti-cheat. 

from my understanding, this is a great unity-based game to learn how to develop internal/external hacks.   



*...because how the hell do we have rocket ships but not wristwatches?*

# known issues
the time conversion function sucks (specifically 12's show as the wrong am/pm)
